# Jewel Augmentation 3D
A web application that takes the live webcam feed as input and augments a 3D jewellery model onto the nose of the person.

Mediapipe's face mesh solution is used to detect 3D facial landmarks. Using a collection of appropriate landmarks a 3D jewellery model is appropriately positioned, scaled, and oriented, in real-time, based on the orientation of the user's face.
